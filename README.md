# jw.res
Near Realtime Resonant Model Generation

jw.res is an object for Max intended for near real time generation of resonance models from signals in buffer~ objects. It uses a method of fractional bin analysis to produce resonant models suitable for use with CNMAT's sinusoids~ and resonators~ objects. The object is the subject of a forthcoming ICMC paper and is still considered an experimental object as of April 2025.
