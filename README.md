# qrm~
Near Realtime Resonant Model Generation

qrm~ is an object for Max intended for near real time generation of resonance models from signals in buffer~ objects. It uses a method of fractional bin analysis to produce resonant models suitable for use with CNMAT's sinusoids~ and resonators~ objects. The object is the subject of a 2025 ICMC paper and is still considered an experimental object as of May 2025.
